 Introduction : 
  This code represents a simple implementation of a task tracking web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Python backend.
  The app allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal tasks with features like task creation, editing, deletion, and live searching. 
  Tasks are stored in a local JSON file.
